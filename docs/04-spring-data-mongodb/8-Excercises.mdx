# Time to Code!
Now that we've done an overview of CRUD operations with Spring Data MongoDB,
it's time to implement what we've learned. Everything you need to get coding is available in the 
previous sections. Once you think you have everything implemented, run the command and see if 
everything runs as expected.

## Create
In `Create.java`, see if you can implement the following methods:

1. Save `grade1` to your MongoDB database.
2. Save the list of grades, `grades` to your database.

To test, run;
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=create
```

## Read
In `Read.java`, see if you can implement the following methods:

1. Find a grade by student ID
2. Find all grades with student IDs greater than or equal to 10000
3. Find all grades by student ID and limit by class ID

To test, run;
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=read
```

## Update
In `Update.java`, see if you can implement the following methods:

1. Update a Document by Adding a Comment: Find a document by `studentId` 
and add a comment to it.
2. Upsert a Document: Find a document by `studentId` and `classId`. If the 
document exists, update it by adding a new score. If it doesn't exist, 
create a new document with the provided details.
3. Update Multiple Documents: Find all documents where `studentId` is 
greater than or equal to 10001, and update them.
4. Find and Update a Document: Find a document by `studentId`, update 
it, and save the changes.

To test, run;
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=update
```

## Delete
In `Delete.java`, implement the following methods to practice deleting 
documents in MongoDB:

1. Delete a Single Document: Delete a grade it if it exists.
2. Find and Delete a Document: Find a document with student id of 10002 
by `studentId`, then delete it.
3. Delete Multiple Documents: Find all documents where `studentId` is 
greater than or equal to 10000, and delete them.

To test, run;
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=delete
```

## Mapping POJOs
Lastly, let's map a POJO to our Document. In `MappingPOJO.java`, create 
a grade called `newGrade` that has a unique `ObjectId`, a `studentId` 
of 10003 (decimal), a `classId` of 10 (decimal).

Also, when creating the new grade, add a score for a homework with a 
score of 50 (decimal).

To test, run;
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=mapping
```
