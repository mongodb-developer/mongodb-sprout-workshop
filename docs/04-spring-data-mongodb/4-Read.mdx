# Read
We have our documents stored, but now we want to read them! Let's start with two common operations:
- `findAll()`
- `findById()`


## findAll
To retrieve all the grades form the database, all you need is the `findAll()` method provided by the `StudentRepository`. 
This method will return all the grade documents present in the grades collection.

```java
public List<Grade> getAllGrades() {
    return repository.findAll();
}
```

## findById
To retrieve individual documents, you can use the `findById()` method provided by the `StudentRepository`. This allows you 
to retrieve an individual document from the database, identified by the `ObjectId`.

```java
public Optional<Grade> getGradeById(String id) {
    return repository.findById(id);
}
```

## Query Generation
While these methods are powerful as they are, it only touches on the capabilities of `MongoRepository`. Query generation allows 
us to build queries solely based of the method names. If we look back on our document model for this collection;

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "studentId": double,
  "classId": double,
  "scores": [
    {
      "type": String,
      "score": double
    }
  ],
  "comment": String
}
```

Imagine if you wanted to search by `comment`. With `MongoRepository`, all you have to do is create a method called `findByComment(String comment)` 
and it will generate a query to find documents with a specific comment.

There are a number of ways you can adjust these methods, such as paging, iterating large results, sorting & limiting, and 
if you want to read about the nitty gritty of each of these, head over to the 
[Spring Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/reference/repositories/query-methods-details.html).  

In simple terms, When creating query method names, they are split into two parts: the **subject** and the **predicate**.

1. **Subject:** The first part (like findBy or existsBy) tells what the query will do.
2. **Predicate:** The second part describes the conditions of the query.

The subject can include additional words that describe the query. Any words between `find` (or other starting keywords) 
and `By` are just for description, unless they are special keywords like `Distinct` (to ensure unique results) or 
`Top`/`First` (to limit the number of results). You can see what each word maps to in the 
[Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/reference/repositories/query-keywords-reference.html), 
and it is largely intuitive.

For example, in the method `findTop3ByAge`, `findTop3` is the subject, and `ByAge` is the predicate. The `Top3` indicates 
that the query should return the first three results based on the `Age` condition.
