# Create

Welcome to the begininning of CRUD! MongoRepository provides methods for creating, 
reading, updating, and deleting documents in a MongoDB collection. It includes methods 
like `save()`, `findById()`, `findAll()`, `deleteById()`, etc.  

The create operation involves inserting or adding new data to the database, creating a new record or document.
## save
To create a single grade, you can use the `save()` method provided by the `StudentRepository`. 
Create a new instance of the `Grade` class, set its attributes, and call the `save()` method to persist it to the database.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class StudentService {
    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository repository;

    public Grade saveGrade(Grade grade) {
        return repository.save(grade);
    }
}
```
## saveAll
To create multiple grades at once, use the `saveAll()` method provided by the `StudentRepository`. Pass a list of `Grade` objects 
to this method, and it will save all the grades in a single batch operation.

```java
public List<Grade> saveGrades(List<Grade> grades) {
    return repository.saveAll(grades);
}
```

## insert
Alternatively, you can use the `insert()` method provided by the `StudentRepository` to insert a grade into the database. 
This method differs from `save()` in that it only performs an insert operation and does not perform an update if 
the grade already exists.

```java
public Grade insertGrade(Grade grade) {
    return repository.insert(grade);
}
```
