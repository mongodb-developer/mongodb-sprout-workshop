# Delete
Deleting records involves removing existing documents from the database. MongoRepository provides methods 
to perform these deletions, such as `delete()`, `deleteById()`, `deleteAll()`, and custom query methods.

## delete (Delete a Single Document)
To delete a single document, you can use the `delete()` method. This method will delete the specified document 
from the database.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class StudentService {
    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository repository;

    public void deleteGrade(Grade grade) {
        repository.delete(grade);
    }
}
```

To delete a grade by `studentId`:
```java
@Autowired
private StudentRepository repository;

public void deleteGradeByStudentId(double studentId) {
    Grade grade = repository.findByStudentId(studentId);
    if (grade != null) {
        repository.delete(grade);
        System.out.println("Deleted grade: " + grade);
    }
}
```

## deleteById
To delete a document by its id, you can use the `deleteById()` method. This method will delete the document 
identified by the given id.

To delete a grade by its id:

```java
@Autowired
private StudentRepository repository;

public void deleteGradeById(String gradeId) {
    repository.deleteById(gradeId);
    System.out.println("Deleted grade with id: " + gradeId);
}
```

## deleteAll (Delete Multiple Documents)
To delete multiple documents at once, use the `deleteAll()` method provided by the `StudentRepository`. 
You can pass a list of `Grade` objects to this method, and it will delete all the specified grades.

To delete all grades with `studentId` greater than or equal to 10000:

```java
@Autowired
private StudentRepository repository;

public void deleteGradesForStudentIdGreaterThanEqual(double studentId) {
    repository.deleteAll(repository.findByStudentIdGreaterThanEqual(studentId));
    System.out.println("Deleted all grades with student_id >= " + studentId);
}
```

## deleteAll (Drop Entire Collection)
To delete all documents in a collection, you can use the `deleteAll()` method without any arguments. 
This method will delete all the documents in the specified collection.

To delete the entire contents of the grades collection:

```java
@Autowired
private StudentRepository repository;

public void deleteAllGrades() {
    repository.deleteAll();
    System.out.println("Deleted the entire grades collection.");
}
```

Depending on your reasoning for deleting the entire contents of a collecion, it might make more sense 
for you to just drop the collection. In which case, using the `dropCollection()` method from `MongoTemplate` is a far more 
performant choice;

```java
mongoTemplate.dropCollection("collectionName");
```
