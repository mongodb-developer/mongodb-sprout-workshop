# Transactions

MongoDB introduced multi-document ACID transactions in version 4.0, enhancing its capabilities to ensure data 
integrity across multiple documents, collections, and databases. This feature brought MongoDB closer to traditional 
relational databases, providing a robust mechanism for handling complex transactional data operations.  

## Key Concepts
1. **ACID Properties:** MongoDB transactions ensure Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability across multiple documents. 
This means that a group of operations either all succeed together or fail together without affecting the database's consistency.
2. **Snapshot Isolation:** MongoDB uses snapshot isolation to maintain consistency. This means that all reads within a transaction 
will see a consistent snapshot of the database, and modifications made by a transaction are invisible to others until the transaction commits.
3. **Change Streams:** MongoDB allows applications to access real-time data changes without the complexity and risk of tailing the oplog. 
This feature, introduced in MongoDB 3.6, enables applications to stream changes to documents in a database in real-time.  

## Example Scenario: Implementing a Shopping Cart
Let’s consider a scenario where a shopping cart application needs to manage product inventory and customer carts atomically to prevent selling more 
items than available in stock.  

Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Clone the Java project using Git and set up the project:  
```bash
git ...
```

## Step 2: Understanding the Code Structure
The project contains two main classes:

 - ChangeStreams.java: Monitors data changes in MongoDB.
 - Transactions.java: Handles the transaction logic.
## Step 3: Running the Demo

## Step 4: Observing Behaviors
1. **Without Transaction:** Attempt to update stock and add items to the cart separately. This can potentially lead 
to inconsistencies if one operation fails.
2. **With Transaction:** Perform both operations atomically. If the stock is insufficient, the transaction will roll back, 
preventing any changes to the database and ensuring consistency.  

## Conclusion
MongoDB’s support for multi-document transactions allows developers to handle complex data changes with ease, ensuring 
data integrity and consistency across operations. This makes MongoDB suitable for applications requiring robust transactional support, similar to traditional relational databases.
