# CSFLE
This section explores the integration of MongoDB's Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) with Spring Data MongoDB, 
focusing on securing data directly from the client side before it is stored in the database. This approach is crucial 
for compliance with data privacy laws and regulations.

## Key Concepts
 - **Client-Side Encryption:** Data is encrypted on the client side before being sent to the server. Only encrypted data is stored in the database, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.
 - **Key Management:** CSFLE uses a Key Management Service (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely. The keys are never exposed to the MongoDB server.
 - **Automatic Encryption:** Developers can specify which fields should be encrypted. MongoDB's client library handles the encryption and decryption transparently.

## Setup Key Vault Collection
The first step involves setting up the key vault collection, which stores the encryption keys. 

## Configuration:
Create a unique index on the keyAltNames field to ensure each key is easily retrievable without duplication.
Example Java Code Snippet:
```java
MongoDatabase db = mongoClient.getDatabase("encryption");
MongoCollection<Document> keyVault = db.getCollection("__keyVault");
keyVault.createIndex(Indexes.ascending("keyAltNames"), new IndexOptions().unique(true));
```

## Creating Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)
Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) are used to encrypt the sensitive fields specified in the MongoDB documents.

DEK Generation Process:
Utilize the ClientEncryption class to generate DEKs.
Store these keys in the key vault collection, ensuring they are managed securely and efficiently.
Entity Encryption with JSON Schemas
Define your application data models using Spring Data MongoDB and annotate fields that require encryption.

Example Entity Class:
```java
@Document(collection = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    private String id;
    @Encrypted(keyId = "userKey", algorithm = "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic")
    private String ssn; // Social Security Number
}
```
This annotation tells Spring Data MongoDB to encrypt the ssn field using the specified encryption key and algorithm.

## SpEL Expression Evaluation
Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is used to dynamically assign encryption keys based on the document context. This feature allows for flexible encryption configurations that can vary per document.

## JSON Schema and MongoClient Connection
MongoDB uses JSON Schema to specify which fields should be encrypted. This schema is configured in the MongoClient settings, which enables automatic encryption without altering application logic.

MongoClient Customization:
```java
MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
    .autoEncryptionSettings(autoEncryptionSettings)
    .build();
```
This settings object configures the client instance to automatically encrypt and decrypt fields based on the defined JSON Schema.

## Conclusion
Integrating CSFLE with Spring Data MongoDB provides a powerful tool for developers to secure sensitive data, ensuring that encryption is handled 
transparently and efficiently. By leveraging CSFLE, applications can meet stringent security and compliance requirements while maintaining performance 
and data integrity.
