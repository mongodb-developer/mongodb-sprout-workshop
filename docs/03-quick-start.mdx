# üèÅ Quick Start 
Before we dive into the content, let's ensure that your environment is properly set up.

# 1. Install Java 21

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21 installed.
2. You can check if it's installed by running:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
    Ensure that the output includes `java 21`.
3. If it's not installed, download and install it from the official [OpenJDK website](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/).

# 2. Clone the Workshop Repository
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
   - With ssh:
   ```bash
   git clone -b session1 git@github.com:mongodb-developer/mdb-java-workshop.git mdb-java-workshop
   ```
   - With https:
    ```bash
    git clone -b session1 https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mdb-java-workshop.git mdb-java-workshop
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd mdb-java-workshop
    ```
# 3. Create a MongoDB Atlas Account
1. Visit [MongoDB Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?utm_campaign=devrel&utm_source=workshop&utm_term=devrel.springio.workshop.java) and sign up for a free account.
2. Follow the instructions to create a new project and a MongoDB cluster.
3. Make sure to note down your cluster's connection details; you'll need them to connect your application.
4. Load your cluster with your sample dataset.  

Once you've completed these steps, you'll be ready to follow along with the workshop!
