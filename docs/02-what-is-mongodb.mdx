# What is MongoDB

MongoDB is a type of NoSQL database that is used for managing large volumes of data. 
The name “Mongo” comes from “Humongous,” describing the data size the software is meant for. 

MongoDB is a document database. 
MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like (BSON) documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document 
and data structure can be changed over time.

The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with.

MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, 
and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.

MongoDB uses collections to store a bulk load of data. Within the collections are documents analogous to rows 
in a table in the relational database system. Documents (which can have multiple and different fields and 
data types) are made up of keys, the most basic data unit in MongoDB. 

One can alter the structure of already saved data in a document under the NoSQL MongoDB by adding or 
removing new and current fields. Different data types can also be used with the same document. 
This gives MongoDB a flexible structure.
